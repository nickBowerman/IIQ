About: These scripts were originally designed to perform large-scale token replacement on Sailpoint Application XML files, replacing the values in 
the XML with the token value and then inserting the original value into a formatted target.properties file.
They are not generic enough in their current state to work with any application type and must be modified to specify the values to target and the token 
naming conventions to use, but the basic framework for it is there if it's ever needed again.
